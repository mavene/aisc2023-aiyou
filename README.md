## AI-You

![](/app/static/resources/logo_aiyou.svg)

This project is a team submission to AI Singapore for the AI Student Challenge 2023. 

### About

AI-You came about as a recognition of the drowning whirlwinds of information people face and the decisions they make in their everyday lives. Whether it's planning a date with someone for the first time, or special events with loved ones, it can be quite *'lece'* to pour over paragraphs of reviews to find the next adventure for you.

Powered by the Sentic GCN model through SGnlp, AI-You helps you and me sift through the haze of text, emojis and endless star ratings to get to what we want to know - *people say good or not?*

Providing sentiment analysis on key specific areas like cleanliness, ambience along with the basics like location and contacts, AI-You promises to help your search not just be efficient but a happier experience with this all-in-one web application.

Too many reviews? Well... AI-got-you.

### Setup

You can choose to clone this project repository from Github or download the zip file from above. On your terminal or Git Bash, type the following:

```shell
cd "any_folder_path_you_want_here"
git clone https://github.com/mavene/aisc2023-aiyou
```

Then, run the setup file to run the demo:

```shell
python setup.py
```

You should now see this message at the end of the running terminal:

```shell
