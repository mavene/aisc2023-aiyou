Mee pok still eatable, else I would have rate 1 star like most of the reviewers. I wonder if only this branch, or all other Encik Tan also drop standard now.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

Front crew only know how to shout  instead of speaking nicely. How rude. I understand can be peak hours sometimes but please its basic courtesy. The male cashier is the friendliest out of the front crew. Also payment methods quite limited to cash and shopee pay. Since u guys have so many outlets why can't you use paynow????","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

Price wise, affordable. I don't expect first class service, but one thing put this branch down specially during covid19 pandemic, the queue system to collect the rice/noodle food doesn't use number like fried delight collection. The staffs just shouting2 the food name for cust to collect. They even forget our order, just say because other cust took our food. No apologize, just excuse. What a disaster.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

The Brother Lim Boon Kheng cooking claypot chicken rice did a fantastic job on the dish. My mom who has a decreased appetite actually finished the claypot chicken rice on her own. She said it was “very good”.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

They are open till late (maybe even 24 hours) but half the menu is closed late at night. Staff are friendly and all the food are halal.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155
1,"Encik Tan - OTH Branch","51 Tampines Ave 4 #01-12, Our Tampines Hub, Singapore 528523",7,"Decent food at a decent price. Safest best on the menu is the chicken cutlet. Fish is deep fried and the batter is so thick you won’t know which part of the fish. Avoid fish.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

Esp, Emily, Bernard etc… they were attentive and approachable.. chili sauce here is always refilled before it runs out and the food are served hot and delicious. Their dessert selection is quite interesting and the price is pretty affordable. Good for family gathering etc. Will definitely be back in the near future. Highly recommend!!","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850

Despite the large lunch crowd, starters and drinks were served promptly. Food came 10 minutes after, quite fast. Coleslaw was very fresh. Fish and chips was crispy and tasty. Prices are affordable.","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
2,"Buddy Hoagies Cafe & Grill","11 Bedok North Street 1, #01-27 Heartbeat @ Bedok, Singapore 469662",11,"I ordered the Seafood platter. The prawns were done nicely. The current weekday lunch promotion adds a soup and a drink to main courses ordered. A trainee by the name of Jia Yin served us and she was simply outstanding at her work. Great service!","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
2,"Buddy Hoagies Cafe & Grill","11 Bedok North Street 1, #01-27 Heartbeat @ Bedok, Singapore 469662",12,"Very affordable prices and value for money. Double up chicken for only $14.90 and lamb chop for $15. There’s my favourite rosti too. A steal! Comfortable ambience too. Suitable for a quick family dinner or casual meal with friends. Easily accessible.","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
2,"Buddy Hoagies Cafe & Grill","11 Bedok North Street 1, #01-27 Heartbeat @ Bedok, Singapore 469662",13,"Good choice for budget steak or grilled. Service is good. Staff are friendly and helpful. I think their chicken is better than beef. BTW, good price with reasonable quality. Went for lunch and quite good deal - free drink and soup with a Main ordered. I ordered the Rösti with Chicken and it was actually quite nice! Not too oily with crispy edges. Soup came with halved hotdog bun, toasted on one side, soft on another. Quite family and student friendly place. The staff was attentive, friendly and prompt! I can see they were short handed with the full house, but everyone was efficient and food was served very quickly. Weekday lunch set is very worth it. We forgot to take photos except for this quick picture taken outside their restaurant. Food served was good, kids meal portion was just nice, and once more - great staff made this a very pleasant dining experience.","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
2,"Buddy Hoagies Cafe & Grill","11 Bedok North Street 1, #01-27 Heartbeat @ Bedok, Singapore 469662",14,"terrible food and service. been visiting for past years but in specific their carbonara pasta’s standard dropped tremendously. watery and sour taste. believe is due to the change in chef and a replacement of the dish doesn’t change the problem. will not come back again.","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
2,"Buddy Hoagies Cafe & Grill","11 Bedok North Street 1, #01-27 Heartbeat @ Bedok, Singapore 469662",15,"Ordered the seafood platter and added the soft shell crab.  It was SO SALTY! I could barely finish my meal. Disappointed.","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850

Sometimes it's really delicious! I went to eat today off day, I think it’s different today, it’s okay!","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",17,"Have been here couple of times and both times the experience was amazing. Ordered steak and lamb rack. Both the dishes were excellent with steak being of the right temperature and lamb chops being tender and succulent. The Mediterranean sauce on the lamb chops was amazing. The only issue is that it is always pretty full so wait times will be 30 to 40 mins. Plus drinks will arrive much earlier than the food and you will probably finish the drinks before the good arrive, is they can solve for this issue, that will be great.","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",18,"Even though the food may be pricey in the menu, they are extremely value for money and delicious! The portion is enormous even for their apple juice! Very satisfying meal","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",19,"First time coming and pleasant surprised and overwhelmed with the huge variety in the menu that offers BBQ seafood, Asian and Western. It is a halal restaurant. The food are all generally nice.","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",20,"My first time here and I already like the lively atmosphere, especially so now that it's Christmas night. I like how the place just kinda lights up beautifully with the decorations done. I ordered the Roti John and it was a solid 10-15mins before I got it but it is totally worth it","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",21,"Went here for lunch today (1st Jan 22) and to my surprise the waiting time for food to be served went up to an hour given that our order was not more than a fried rice and hor fun - nothing fancy I would say. Not sure if other food patrons experienced the long wait too. Upon approaching the staff to ask status of my food, I was asked to be patient though the wait was already up to an hour and funny how other tables who came and ordered after us received their food first. I’ve been to Spize @ Rifle Range before and hands down they have the best service by far. Cleanliness, professionalism of staff, fairly good waiting time for food to be ready and etc. If there is one or many things Spize Bedok can improve on, I hope the management will try to look at how Spize Rifle Range operates and deliver the same service too.","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",22,"Rather poor service and attitude from the staffs. Food wasn't properly prepared, hor fun texture was like rubber, cheese fries taste sour, fried chicken cutlet was dry like a rock=( the one star was for the coke which was well chilled, wouldn't recommended this place unless you have low or no expectations on food and services.","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",23,"Seems like they care about profits more than anything else. The food quality is not as good as before. Satay gravy is basically water with peanuts. Don't be fooled by the crowds!","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",24,"Pathetic service. Made eye contact, waved, called out politely but no one took our order.  At least 4 staff walked by and entertained other customers in bigger groups right behind us. Very annoyed with their attitude.","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493

And i wasnt disappointed. Ordered what has become my usual order of two pints of Heineken, Tomato and Mushroom Bruschetta and fries. Go in the late afternoon, early evening when the crowds have yet to come in. The service and food is good. Give this place a try.","www.quandoo.sg/place/the-tipsy-cow-katong-92902?aid=63",84064949
4,"The Tipsy Cow @ Katong","315 Tanjong Katong Rd, Singapore 437098",29,"Cozy place to hang out with friends or family. Menu is kid friendly with good selection of pizza and pastas among other things. I had the pizza with prawns and mussels, and the tipsy wings. Both really good! Pizza is freshly made and cooked in brick oven - worth the wait. Pizza base was thin and crispy and loaded with cheese. Chicken wings were tasty and I loved the chili sauce that comes with it. Wide selection of drinks to suit everyone. I had a pint of Kirin while my wife had a frozen margarita. Loved the 80s pop music too.","www.quandoo.sg/place/the-tipsy-cow-katong-92902?aid=63",84064949
4,"The Tipsy Cow @ Katong","315 Tanjong Katong Rd, Singapore 437098",30,"Nice place to chill but food is subpar. Drinks are decent. Service is good and quick. We tried the lamb rack which was overcooked and the pork ribs which were hard. The chicken nachos were too salty.","www.quandoo.sg/place/the-tipsy-cow-katong-92902?aid=63",84064949
4,"The Tipsy Cow @ Katong","315 Tanjong Katong Rd, Singapore 437098",31,"I love the blue cheese chicken here. Ham + creamy blue cheese + chicken, the combo is great! The only reason I keep going back. Drinks selection isn't great for non alcoholics. The ambience is ok, but the cleanliness can be improved by alot. Bits of rubbish can be seen at the floor and sides, can be quite disgusting.","www.quandoo.sg/place/the-tipsy-cow-katong-92902?aid=63",84064949
