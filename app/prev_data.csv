Mee pok still eatable, else I would have rate 1 star like most of the reviewers. I wonder if only this branch, or all other Encik Tan also drop standard now.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

They are open till late (maybe even 24 hours) but half the menu is closed late at night. Staff are friendly and all the food are halal.","enciktan.com.sg/",63701155

Esp, Emily, Bernard etc… they were attentive and approachable.. chili sauce here is always refilled before it runs out and the food are served hot and delicious. Their dessert selection is quite interesting and the price is pretty affordable. Good for family gathering etc. Will definitely be back in the near future. Highly recommend!!","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850

Despite the large lunch crowd, starters and drinks were served promptly. Food came 10 minutes after, quite fast. Coleslaw was very fresh. Fish and chips was crispy and tasty. Prices are affordable.","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850

Sometimes it's really delicious! I went to eat today off day, I think it’s different today, it’s okay!","buddyhoagies.com.sg",62828850
3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",17,"Have been here couple of times and both times the experience was amazing. Ordered steak and lamb rack. Both the dishes were excellent with steak being of the right temperature and lamb chops being tender and succulent. The Mediterranean sauce on the lamb chops was amazing. The only issue is that it is always pretty full so wait times will be 30 to 40 mins. Plus drinks will arrive much earlier than the food and you will probably finish the drinks before the good arrive, is they can solve for this issue, that will be great.","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493

3,"Spize @ Bedok","338 Bedok Rd, Singapore 469516",20,"My first time here and I already like the lively atmosphere, especially so now that it's Christmas night. I like how the place just kinda lights up beautifully with the decorations done. I ordered the Roti John and it was a solid 10-15mins before I got it but it is totally worth it","ccpl.ninjaos.com",63377493

4,"The Tipsy Cow @ Katong","315 Tanjong Katong Rd, Singapore 437098",30,"Nice place to chill but food is subpar. Drinks are decent. Service is good and quick. We tried the lamb rack which was overcooked and the pork ribs which were hard. The chicken nachos were too salty.","www.quandoo.sg/place/the-tipsy-cow-katong-92902?aid=63",84064949
4,"The Tipsy Cow @ Katong","315 Tanjong Katong Rd, Singapore 437098",31,"I love the blue cheese chicken here. Ham + creamy blue cheese + chicken, the combo is great! The only reason I keep going back. Drinks selection isn't great for non alcoholics. The ambience is ok, but the cleanliness can be improved by alot. Bits of rubbish can be seen at the floor and sides, can be quite disgusting.","www.quandoo.sg/place/the-tipsy-cow-katong-92902?aid=63",84064949
