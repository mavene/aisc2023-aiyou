1,"Encik Tan - OTH Branch","51 Tampines Ave 4 #01-12, Our Tampines Hub, Singapore 528523",1,"Encik Tan used to serve decent chicken chop curry rice, not sure why so lousy now, the curry is watery and tasteless, the vege super nua and not fresh, fried egg also very cin cai, braised sauce is missing. Mee pok still eatable, else I would have rate 1 star like most of the reviewers. I wonder if only this branch, or all other Encik Tan also drop standard now.","https://enciktan.com.sg/",63701155
1,"Encik Tan - OTH Branch","52 Tampines Ave 4 #01-12, Our Tampines Hub, Singapore 528523",2,"Food is so so I don't expect much. Reasonable price. Front crew only know how to shout  instead of speaking nicely. How rude. I understand can be peak hours sometimes but please its basic courtesy. The male cashier is the friendliest out of the front crew. Also payment methods quite limited to cash and shopee pay. Since u guys have so many outlets why can't you use paynow????", "https://enciktan.com.sg/",63701155
