1,1,"Encik Tan used to serve decent chicken chop curry rice, not sure why so lousy now, the curry is watery and tasteless, the vege super nua and not fresh, fried egg also very cin cai, braised sauce is missing. Mee pok still eatable, else I would have rate 1 star like most of the reviewers. I wonder if only this branch, or all other Encik Tan also drop standard now.","John Tan","September 2019"
1,7,"Decent food at a decent price. Safest best on the menu is the chicken cutlet. Fish is deep fried and the batter is so thick you won’t know which part of the fish. Avoid fish.","Mariam Junaidi","October 2021"

2,9,"This is my favourite outlet for the Buddy hoagies chain, staffs here were mostly very friendly! Esp, Emily, Bernard etc… they were attentive and approachable.. chili sauce here is always refilled before it runs out and the food are served hot and delicious. Their dessert selection is quite interesting and the price is pretty affordable. Good for family gathering etc. Will definitely be back in the near future. Highly recommend!!","Maya","December 2021"
2,10,"Large and spacious. Service was prompt. Came for lunch. Despite the large lunch crowd, starters and drinks were served promptly. Food came 10 minutes after, quite fast. Coleslaw was very fresh. Fish and chips was crispy and tasty. Prices are affordable.","Naid","June 2019"

2,16,"Come off day once a week, the food is good, but sometimes it feels like a different person cooks it! Sometimes it's really delicious! I went to eat today off day, I think it’s different today, it’s okay!","Zhi Hui","March 2019"
3,17,"Have been here couple of times and both times the experience was amazing. Ordered steak and lamb rack. Both the dishes were excellent with steak being of the right temperature and lamb chops being tender and succulent. The Mediterranean sauce on the lamb chops was amazing. The only issue is that it is always pretty full so wait times will be 30 to 40 mins. Plus drinks will arrive much earlier than the food and you will probably finish the drinks before the good arrive, is they can solve for this issue, that will be great.","David","November 2019"

3,20,"My first time here and I already like the lively atmosphere, especially so now that it's Christmas night. I like how the place just kinda lights up beautifully with the decorations done. I ordered the Roti John and it was a solid 10-15mins before I got it but it is totally worth it","Christina","March 2020"

4,30,"Nice place to chill but food is subpar. Drinks are decent. Service is good and quick. We tried the lamb rack which was overcooked and the pork ribs which were hard. The chicken nachos were too salty.","Mark Plier","June 2019"
